# Chapter 5: Control Flow in C

"C Programming: A Modern Approach" by K. N. King delves into various aspects of control flow in C programming in Chapter 5. Below is a general overview:

## Topics Covered:

1. **Control Flow**
   - Understanding the sequence in which a program executes statements.

2. **If Statements**
   - Introduction to conditional execution.
   - Basic `if` statement.
   - The `if-else` structure.
   - The `if-else if-else` chain.

3. **Switch Statements**
   - Using `switch` as an alternative to multiple `if-else` conditions.

4. **While Loops**
   - Loops that execute a block of code as long as a condition remains true.

5. **For Loops**
   - Compact loop structure ideal when the number of iterations is known beforehand.

6. **Do-While Loops**
   - Like `while` loops, but the condition is checked after the loop body, ensuring at least one execution.

7. **Break and Continue**
   - `break`: Exits a loop prematurely.
   - `continue`: Skips the current iteration and moves to the next.

8. **Goto and Labels**
   - Introduction to `goto`, though its use is generally discouraged in modern programming.

9. **Boolean Expressions**
   - Understanding expressions that evaluate to true or false.

10. **Common Pitfalls and Best Practices**
   - Discussing frequent mistakes with control structures and ways to avoid them.
