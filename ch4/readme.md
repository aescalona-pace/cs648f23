# C Programming: Chapter 4 Summary
**Expressions, Operators, and Precedence**

## Basic Expressions
- How values and operators combine to form expressions.
- How C evaluates expressions to produce a result.

## Arithmetic Operators
- Binary operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
- Unary operators: `-` (negation), `+` (usually redundant and often omitted)

## Relational and Equality Operators
- Relational: `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
- Equality: `==`, `!=`

## Logical Operators
- `&&`: Logical AND
- `||`: Logical OR
- `!`: Logical NOT

## Increment and Decrement Operators
- `++`: Increment by 1
- `--`: Decrement by 1

## Assignment Operators
- `=`: Basic assignment
- Compound assignments: `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`, etc.

## Conditional (Ternary) Operator
- A compact way to evaluate simple conditions: `expr1 ? expr2 : expr3`

## [Precedence and Order of Evaluation](precedence_and_order.md)
- The rules governing the order in which operators are evaluated.
- Importance of parentheses to change the default order and clarify intentions.

## Type Conversions
- Implicit conversions: How C automatically converts one data type to another.
- Explicit conversions (casting): Using type names as unary operators.

## Common Pitfalls
- Division by zero.
- Imprecision in floating-point arithmetic.
- Unexpected order of evaluation.
  
## Best Practices
- Using parentheses for clarity.
- Avoiding reliance on obscure precedence rules.
- Being aware of potential side effects in expressions.
